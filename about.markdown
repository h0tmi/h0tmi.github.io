## Hi, I'm Timofey Zhamoidin

I'm a Software Engineer specializing in backend development and distributed systems, with a focus on high-performance C++ and Python development for large-scale services.

Currently, I work at **Yandex** on the Search as a Service team, where I architect distributed indexing systems serving 700+ internal services. Previously, I worked on YTSaurus (handling 3 EB of data) and voice technology infrastructure serving 57 million users.

I'm passionate about:
- Algorithm optimization and performance tuning
- Distributed systems and infrastructure engineering
- Building reliable, scalable backend services

### Background

I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the **Yandex School of Data Analysis** (Big Data Track) and completing my Bachelor's at the **Higher School of Economics** in Moscow.
